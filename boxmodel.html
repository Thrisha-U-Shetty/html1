    The Mozilla Manifesto is a set of guiding principles that outline the mission and values of the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla Corporation. It was first published in March 2007 and has been updated over time to reflect changes in technology and society. The manifesto emphasizes the importance of the open web, user control, privacy, and accessibility.
